            This was an essay I wrote for my English Composition I class. The topic of this essay was genres, but not in the sense most people would think of.<br>
            In this context, a genre is a type of writing for a certain purpose, like a public speech or a manual for a car. I had originally planned on writing<br>
            about public speeches as my genre, but my professor told me that was too broad of a subject. I decided to opt for a much smaller genre, which was the <br>
            skill descriptions in the Monster Hunter video game series. I felt I was much more versed in this topic, as Monster Hunter is a series I greatly enjoy. <br>
