        <p>
            This was my final assignment for a class I took, Object Oriented Programming. In this class, we learned how to use java, though it was<br>
            mostly a refresher for me, as I took a java class in high school. This class did, however, teach me a few new methods for coding in java, <br>
            like linked lists, which I had to program in this assignment.
